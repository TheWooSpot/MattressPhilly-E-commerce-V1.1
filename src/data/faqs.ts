    question: "How do I know which mattress firmness is right for me?",
    answer: "Your ideal firmness depends on your sleeping position, body weight, and personal preference. Side sleepers typically prefer softer mattresses (3-6/10 firmness) that cushion pressure points at the shoulders and hips. Back and stomach sleepers usually need medium-firm to firm mattresses (6-8/10) for proper spinal alignment. Heavier individuals (over 230 lbs) generally need firmer support, while lighter individuals often prefer softer surfaces. Our sleep specialists can help you find your perfect match during a showroom visit, or you can take advantage of our sleep trial period to test your mattress at home."

    question: "What's the difference between memory foam, hybrid, and innerspring mattresses?",
    answer: "Memory foam mattresses contour closely to your body, providing excellent pressure relief and motion isolation, but may sleep warmer than other types. Hybrid mattresses combine a coil support core with foam comfort layers, offering a balance of bounce, support, and contouring with better temperature regulation than all-foam models. Innerspring mattresses use a coil support system with minimal padding, providing a responsive, bouncy surface with excellent airflow but less pressure relief than foam or hybrid options. Each type has its benefits, and the best choice depends on your sleep preferences and needs."

    question: "Do I need a box spring with my new mattress?",
    answer: "Most modern mattresses, including all those sold at Mattress Philly, don't require a traditional box spring. However, all mattresses need proper support. Platform beds with slats no more than 3-4 inches apart, adjustable bases, and foundation/box foundations all work well. If you're using an older bed frame designed for a box spring, you'll need to add either a bunkie board or a foundation. Using an incompatible base may void your warranty, so please consult our sleep specialists if you're unsure about your current setup."

    question: "How long should a quality mattress last?",
    answer: "A high-quality mattress should last 7-10 years, though this varies by material and construction. Latex mattresses typically have the longest lifespan (8-12 years), followed by high-density memory foam and hybrid mattresses (7-10 years), and traditional innerspring mattresses (5-7 years). Factors that can extend mattress life include using a mattress protector, rotating your mattress regularly (if recommended by the manufacturer), using proper support/foundation, and keeping pets off the bed. All Mattress Philly mattresses come with warranties ranging from 10-25 years, depending on the model."

    question: "What is your return policy and trial period?",
    answer: "All Mattress Philly mattresses come with a sleep trial period ranging from 60-180 nights, depending on the model. We require that you sleep on your new mattress for at least 30 nights to allow your body to adjust before initiating a return. If you're not satisfied after the break-in period, contact our customer service team to arrange a return or exchange. Returns within the trial period receive a full refund, minus any delivery or setup fees. For exchanges, we'll apply the value of your original purchase to your new selection (price differences will be charged or refunded accordingly). A single exchange is allowed per original purchase."

    question: "How do I care for and maintain my new mattress?",
    answer: "To maximize the lifespan of your mattress: 1) Use a waterproof mattress protector from day one to guard against spills, stains, and allergens; 2) Rotate your mattress 180 degrees every 3-6 months (unless the manufacturer advises otherwise); 3) Follow manufacturer guidelines for cleaning - typically spot cleaning with mild detergent and water; 4) Ensure proper support with a compatible foundation or frame; 5) Avoid sitting on the edge of the mattress for prolonged periods; 6) Never fold or bend your mattress; and 7) When moving, always transport your mattress in an upright position in a mattress bag. Specific care instructions are included with each mattress and available on our website."
